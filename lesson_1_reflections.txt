How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It gave me the differences between both files and marked where this difference was located
Thanks to this it was easy to just compare the lines that where different and spot the error

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Because if the software crashes after the latest change I can go back to previous working versions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros:  saving points are meaninguful if the user has choosen a good point on where to save, navigating through different versions of the files is asier
Cons: If user chooses changes too big or too small, or forgets to save

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one
commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
In programming it is easier to have files interrelatd and that one commit may affect multipe files
for text files like in google docs will be different and one file shouldnt affect the other
